# Super Canvasser

Super Canvasser helps organizations run door-to-door canvassing campaigns (sales campaign, fund-raising campaign, election campaign, opinion poll, etc.).  The system supports three roles: campaign managers, who manage the information associated with campaigns; canvassers, who visit the locations in campaigns on assigned dates; and system administrators, who manage user accounts.
